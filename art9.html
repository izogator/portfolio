            <p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; padding: 10px;">Our task for this assignment was to create a campaign website that Foodsharing could use to fight the problem of food waste.
                My role in the group was plant and shaper but also conceptualizer. </p>

            <p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; padding: 10px;">We all from the beginning wanted to work on the problem of food waste, so the decision on the subject was easy. We did desk research which leads us to agree that our target audience is households because that is where the problem is the biggest.
                After that, we worked on title, logline, theme and treatment.
                Our title was "Fruit positivity" and the theme was "Don't judge a book by its cover.
                After that, we moved to the storyboard. </p>

            <p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; padding: 10px;">We decided to shot the video form the viewers' point of view so that they can put themselves in that situation. We shoot it with GoPro to make that effect even more personal.
            </p>

            <p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; padding: 10px;">Editing video was a bit challenging because the quality of the video was not as good as we expected. Thankfully colour grading helped a lot. We added subtitles because a lot of people prefer to watch videos without sound.
            </p>
            <p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; padding: 10px;">When the video was ready we moved to work on the website. First, we created a prototype in XD which helped us visualise the design without spending lots of time on coding. After agreeing on the style we moved to code. We created an SVG animation which was a circle of an outline of Copenhagen which is spinning around the recyclable icon. We made it to catch user attention.
            </p>
            <p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; padding: 10px;">For social media, we wanted to do something different, so it gets a lot of attention. We decided to make a boomerang video. The meaning of that video is that you should think twice before you throw food away.
