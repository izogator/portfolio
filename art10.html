                We had to control it through JavaScript which was a bit challenging for me because JavaScript was still very new to me.
                We also got to know a lot of new CSS animations, transitions and transforms - scaling, fading, skew etc.
                Another new thing was implementing sound in HTML and controlling it through JavaScript.
                For this assignment, SVG animation has been introduced. We learned how to outline a text or image, which then we can animate so it is writing or drawing itself. I used it on my page title - word "Birdman" is writing itself when you open the page and then it is filling itself with colour. </p>
