            <p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; padding: 10px;">For this assignment, we learned about different ways of collecting data - desk research, observation research, interview research and survey research. </p>

            <p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; padding: 10px;">For the desk research, I chose a topic about Lego used as a part of children's learning. I loved Lego as a kid so I found that topic very interesting. We did this kind of research earlier in the studies, so it was not hard to do. I searched on the internet for articles relevant to the subject and collected information which later build my article. </p>

            <p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; padding: 10px;">We were also introduced to observation research which was something new, but I learned it by trying it straight away. It is a method, by which you gather information about behaviour by observing it with your own senses. I chose Kitchen culture topic and went to a supermarket close by in a rush hour and stood next to register machine for around 30min observing people in the line. I did notes and took a few pictures for documentation.
            </p>

            <p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; padding: 10px;">For the assignment, we also did interview research. We learned about different kinds of interviews like formal and informal or structured and semi-structured. I decided to do my interview with a friend so I choose to do it informally and semi-structured because I wanted to have the freedom to change the questions depending on the answers. Teacher gives as few tips on how to make the interviewee feel comfortable. For example, start the interview with small talk and show interest. He also suggested that it is better to record the interview rather than take notes, so the person we are talking with feels like is having a regular conversation. </p>

            <p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 30px; padding: 10px;">Making a survey also new to me. I got to know that it is formal and structured. To make a good survey you need to ask the right questions to get the answers you need. It is also important to start with rather simple questions and slowly move to harder ones.

            </p>
            <p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 30px; padding: 10px;">After finishing the research we had to write about our findings and what we learned.</p>
