<h3>02.04.01 - responsive website</h3>

<p>The assignment was to build a responsive website of a given style, including information and images related to the style as well as showing the overall process of creating the website, like creating style tile, moodboard, colour scheme, typography etc. There was a requirement to use responsive principles of front end web design like media queries, grid design and flexible content to build our website.

Making this website was very exciting but also challenging because it was the first website I have ever done. I decided to make a website which will contain information about the given style but do not focus it design on it. The website which I submitted as an answer to the assignment was not as good as I wanted it to be and I wasn't fully happy about it. That is why I edited it after submitting.
The first one was a bit too busy to look at with the picture as a background, so I changed it to a very simple and minimalistic page with only three colours - white, black and pink. Thanks to that the website is now looking cleaner and in my opinion more professional.
I made it that all the text is black on a white background. This way it has a high contrast which is making it easy to read. I put it together with a bit of pink which is adding a bit of fun to it. All these colours work very well together. They nicely contrast with each other making a good harmony.

In the design of my website can be seen that I am using the same font for each type of text e.g. Roboto light for all longer texts like articles. That is an example of the principle similarity. Thanks to that a user will easier be able to navigate between pages and texts.

The basic principles that I used in the coding of HTML and CSS are used of a semantic code typical for HTML5, like "main", "footer", "header" and so on.

Another technique that I used is "media queries" in CSS. Media queries are used to add breakpoints in the CSS and to set rules on how certain parts are supes to change depends on the size of the screen.  I used it to change the way of showing a list of articles. On a screen, smaller than 600px articles will show in a column list, but if the screen is bigger, then it will change into a row.
