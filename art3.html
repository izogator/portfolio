    <div class="art-pic1">
        <div class="art1">
            <p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; padding: 10px;">The assignment was to build an XD prototype of a website using a UI kit, which helps new international students in Copenhagen finding accommodation, a job and a social network.
                Together with Nikola, we agreed that our target group was young adults, so we wanted to make it look appealing to them by making the website in bright energetic colours, but at the same time focus to make it look simple and clear. Young people lose attention very fast so we tried to make the copy minimalistic and containing only the most important information. We also used a lot of graphics and illustrations to drag the viewer attention to the important parts. </p>

            <p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; padding: 10px;">After finishing the first prototype, we run thinking aloud test on our classmates and all of our findings in our earlier research was confirmed by the students - when we asked them to find contact information they all scrolled down to the footer without second of doubt. Also, problems with trying to Log in or create an account also did not occur. Everyone knew where to look for it and what to do. Some of them only said that the link to create an account (in case you do not have
                an account yet) was too small. One of our test subjects also told us that
                they would expect and that they are used to a Login button in the upper-righthand corner, just like we have it. </p>

            <p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; padding: 10px;">We experienced a little problem with saving housing for later because not everyone understood that the heart icon stands for saving
                the accommodation for later use. And it was the one task that took the
                most time to solve.Everyone was quick to find the Sports team page as well when we asked where would they look if they wanted to sign up for a basketball team. The path to finding a move in price was clear to everyone as well.
            </p>

            <p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; padding: 10px;">We want to improve and change the size of the link for creating an
                account because it was not always visible to everyone. Maybe could
                also, think about the better icon for the saving action in the accommodation
                to make it more obvious that when you click on it it will save it for later
                use.</p>

            <p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 30px; padding: 10px;">The conclusions we made following the tests made us change only the size and colour of the link to create an account. We decided to leave the heart icon for now because even though some people had problems linking it to save it for later, the rest of the people liked it.
