    <div class="art-pic1">
        <div class="art1">
            <p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; padding: 10px;">Design sprint - full of energy, creativity and hard work - a group project I did with my amazing team "Avengers". The final goal of the project was to make XD prototype of a native app which will improve student life and studying for international students. Through five days of "Design Sprint" every day was a new phase - a new challenge. We stated with Map and then moved to Sketch, Decide, Prototype and the last one was Test. </p>

            <p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; padding: 10px;">On Monday we started with the idea that we wanted to help international students do things outside of class so that the students
                will integrate into Copenhagen society.
                When thinking about what the best version of the app could look
                like we pictured students using the app to meet other students
                around the city so that they would feel more a part of the community. This would be the primary app for finding things to do with
                other students.</p>

            <p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; padding: 10px;">Through the next days, we did a lot of different excises which helped us to find perfect solutions for our project. For example, we worked with "How Might We...?" and "Crazy 8's". We also did a lot of different sketches to help us illustrate and show our ideas to our groupmates.
            </p>

            <p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; padding: 10px;">When the first prototype was ready we did a few tests together with students we met in cantine and halls of the university. After talking with them we did a few improvements. We added a small pop up message when you first open the Map View giving you quick information about the differences between Events and Hubs. This way we wanted to make it easier for the user to understand the Map
                Page. The icons are very similar and can be confusing if you do not know the context. The Logo on the top part of the Login Page was a problem as well, the second interviewer could not tell that the image was actually the logo. To make it more clear we added the “Join Hub” text under it. We also spotted that some people while looking at the Navigation Bar couldn’t tell in which page they were in.
                That is why we added a “glow” effect on the Navigation Bar behind the icon of the page you’re in.</p>

            <p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 30px; padding: 10px;">For the pitch, we divided the presentation between us, so that each member of the group could say a bit about our project. My part was to walk the audience through our prototype.
